checktsc is a user space program that checks TSC synchronization
between pairs of CPUs on an SMP system using a technique borrowed
from the Linux 2.6.18 kernel.

The test passes if all TSCs are within +/- "threshold" clock cycles
of each other. The default value of "threshold" is 500 clock cycles
and can be changed using the --threshold option.

Default behaviour is to check all of the CPUs on a system and to
report the observed difference in TSC values between each pair of CPUs.
The --cpus option can be used to specify a subset of the CPUs to test.

When run with the --silent option the test produces no output (other
than for catastrophic errors) and success or failure is indicated by
a 0 or 1 exit status from the program.
